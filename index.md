In this lesson, we will demonstrate a series of potentially useful tools to visualize neuroimaging data and make the manual quality control process a lot easier. 

The list of tools we will attempt to cover are:

* SPM visualizer (cross-platform)
* xjView toolbox for SPM (cross-platform)
* FSLeye visualizer (Linux/Mac Only. Windows with Linux VM)
