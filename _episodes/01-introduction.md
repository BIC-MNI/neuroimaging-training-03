# Data 


## Why? 

### Because of GIGO
> GIGO: Garbage in garbage out.

Neuroimaging is about processing data and if at any time the data is bad all you analysis can be meaningless misguided at best worst collegiate a wrong conclusion that should not have been made in the first place
it is one of the most important step before any kind of data analysis but it is also one of the most commonly ignored step
this applies across all of the neuroimaging disciplines from structural neuroimaging analysis to functional neuroimaging analysis to Connectivity neuroimaging analysis etc. etc. no disciplines on the neuroimaging does not require data quality check it is fundamental

> Just imagine what you can do with awesome oribofrontal cortex fMRI data like these when... there are massive holes in your data. I am sure the group comparisons would look nice.  /s

### Because it will help you make figures.

Ever tried to make figures but not sure how to start? Familiarity with these tools will help you get nice figures, QUICKER, EASIER, and less painful.
 
### Because it will help with your analyses regardless of modalities. 

* functional MRI: task or resting state 
* Structural MRI: T1, T2 etc.
* Diffusion
* PET:
