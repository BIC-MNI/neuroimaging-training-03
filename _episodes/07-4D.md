## Quick summary: 

3D data when concatnated to present either time (fMRI cases) or different diffusion signal attenuation directions (diffusion weighted images) will require slightly different way to deal with. 

## SPM Register View

* Convoluted. 
* But works.
* It can view the 4D data as a series of interactive 3D data. 

For more information manipulation with 4D data, you can consult this page.  

## FSLEye

* FSL eye has a movie button that loop through the 3D volumes as a quick short movie. This can be used to conduct quality control,
