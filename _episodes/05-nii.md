## Format / Extension 

* Typically assocated with .nii, .hdr/.img pair
* Probably one of the most popular format

You can read more about the technical details of [Nifti-1](https://brainder.org/2012/09/23/the-nifti-file-format/) format and its contrast with [NIFI-2](https://brainder.org/2015/04/03/the-nifti-2-file-format/). 

It is typically used to store 3D volumetric data. It can store [4D volumetric data] as well but outside of SPM/FSLEye and a few others, 4D data visualization can be more cumbersome.

See relevant chapter at [SPM12 menu](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/spm12_manual.pdf) 

* Display Image Function Module (Chapter 17)

   * Fairly straight forward to use, click on the display button and then choose the image file to display and now you get an interactive way to explore the 3D data.  

* Registry Function (Chapter 18)
   * A hidden jewel within the Registry function is its ability to visualize 4D data as animation.
