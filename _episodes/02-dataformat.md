### Quote from Larobina and Murino, 2014, J Digit Imaging, doi:10.1007/s10278-013-9657-9:

Image file formats provide a standardized way to store the information describing an image in a computer file. A medical image data set consists typically of one or more images representing the projection of an anatomical volume onto an image plane (projection or planar imaging), a series of images representing thin slices through a volume (tomographic or multislice two-dimensional imaging), a set of data from a volume (volume or three-dimensional imaging), or multiple acquisition of the same tomographic or volume image over time to produce a dynamic series of acquisitions (four-dimensional imaging). The file format describes how the image data are organized inside the image file and how the pixel data should be interpreted by a software for the correct loading and visualization.
